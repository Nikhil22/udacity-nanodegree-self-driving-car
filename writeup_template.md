#**Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 

 "My pipeline consists of 5 main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sanitize the image\n",
    "    - Convert the image from RBG to grayscale. \n",
    "    - Apply Gaussian blurring \n",
    "2. Extract the edges using the canny method and mask the triangular region \n",
    "    - For region masking, I did not want to simply hard-code the apex and left/right edge points. So, with some googling around and trial/error, I was able to generalize the region masking's apex, left/ and right coordinates.\n",
    "3. Detect the lines using the Hough transform\n",
    "    - I found that values like rho, theta, etc where quite elastic to change.\n",
    "4. Extract the left and right lane markings\n",
    "5. Paint the lines over the original image\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjustments to draw_lines()\n",
    "\n",
    "I create a class called LaneFinder. This class has method called create_lines() which extrapolates left and right lines using their slopes.\n",
    "A positive slope signifies a left lane line, and a negative one signifies a right lane lane. \n",
    "\n",
    "I use the results of this method and pass it to draw_lines().  I wanted my pipeline to look clean and semantic, so I put all methods in this LaneFinder class, and chained one method call after the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shortcomings\n",
    "1. We assume that nothing is obstructing the lane lines. Snow, a person,vehcile or any other object could hide part or all of a lane line. \n",
    "2. This pipeline would not work well for a road with a curve. That is, a road with edges not triangular in shape would not be captured as well by this pipeline.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvements\n",
    "1. Instead of looking for lines, we could look for a general space in which a lane line is most likely to be. This approach would be robust when the lane is blocked by snow, a vehicle or a person.\n",
    "2. We could modify Hough transform to detect curved lines, too. This would require us to add more dimensions to the Hough space."
